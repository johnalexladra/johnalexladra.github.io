# Hi There! I'm John Alex

This is my official [`GitHub.io page`](./index.php).
Where I code and compile all my projects/works, from a simple HTML & CSS to a 
complete complex PHP & JS web apps using different PHP frameworks.

For more information about me, feel free to visit my ['official website']['site'].

This are following resources that I use in making this project:

- The most popular HTML, CSS and JS Framework - [Bootstrap][bootstrap].
- The iconic font and CSS toolkit - [Font Awesome][fontawesome]
- The [jQuery][jquery] feature-rich JavaScript library.
- The [GitHub Calendar Plugin][gh-calendar].
- The [GitHub Activity Stream][gh-activity].
- The [jQuery][jquery-rss] feature-rich JavaScript library.

## Folder structure

The files are following a MVC architectural pattern that separates an
application into three main components: model, view, and controller.

## Contributing guidelines

I appreciate if you help me improve and develop my projects. In helping me to
keep this collection of mine in high quality, I request that you must follow 
my following guidelines.

- **Provided with three(3) branches here:** developement, staging and master.
  Please do your changes in developement branch, you can create branches
  from the developement branch with your name attached at the last and
  then you can merge it in the main development branch.

- **Name your commits according with tasks**. You can start with the following 
  words: chore, update, fix, testing, feat and remove/delete. Followed by
  semi-colon and the tasks/modification. You can write commit message like this:
  "update: core files"

- **Explain why you’re making a change**. Even if it seems self-evident, please
  take a sentence or two to tell us why your change or addition should happen.
  It’s especially helpful to articulate why this change applies to *everyone*
  who works with the applicable technology, rather than just you or your team.

- **Please consider the scope of your change**. If your change specific to a
  certain language or framework, then make sure the change is made to the
  template for that language or framework, rather than to the template for an
  editor, tool, or operating system.

- **Please only modify *one template* per pull request**. This helps keep pull
  requests and feedback focused on a specific project or technology.

In general, the more you can do to help me understand the change you’re making,
the more likely I’ll be to accept your contribution quickly.

## Contributing workflow

Here’s how I suggest you go about proposing a changes to my projects:

1. [Fork this project][fork] to your account.
2. [Create a branch][branch] for the change you intend to make.
3. Make your changes to your fork.
4. [Send a pull request][pr] from your fork’s branch to our `master` branch.

Using the web-based interface to make changes is fine too, and will help you
by automatically forking the project and prompting to send a pull request too.
